0x18. C - Dynamic libraries
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
What are the differences between static and shared libraries
Basic usage of nm, ldd, ldconfig
Requirements
C
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
Bash
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
All your files must be executable
Tasks
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:

scss
Copy code
int _putchar(char c);
int _islower(int c);
int _isalpha(int c);
int _abs(int n);
int _isupper(int c);
int _isdigit(int c);
int _strlen(char *s);
void _puts(char *s);
char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
int _atoi(char *s);
char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

2. Let's call C functions from Python
Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. See example for more detail.

3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!
I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
