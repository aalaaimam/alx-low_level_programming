0x17. C - Doubly linked lists
Description
This project is a series of C programs focusing on the implementation and manipulation of doubly linked lists. Doubly linked lists are a type of data structure where each element points to both the next and previous elements, enabling efficient traversal in both directions.

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is a doubly linked list
How to use doubly linked lists
Understand and know how to implement various operations (deletion, insertion, etc.) with doubly linked lists
Start to look for the right source of information without too much help
Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, printf, and exit
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Tasks
0. Print list: Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.
1. List length: Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.
2. Add node: Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.
3. Add node at the end: Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.
4. Free list: Write a function that frees a dlistint_t list.
5. Get node at index: Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.
6. Sum list: Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.
7. Insert at index: Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
8. Delete at index: Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.
9. Crackme4: Find the password for crackme4 and save it in a file.
10. Palindromes: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers and save it in a file.
11. Crackme5: Write a keygen for crackme5.
