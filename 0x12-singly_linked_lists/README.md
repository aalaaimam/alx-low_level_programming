# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

## Description

This project covers the implementation of singly linked lists in the C programming language. It includes various tasks aimed at understanding linked lists, such as printing, counting elements, adding nodes, and freeing lists.

## Project Tasks

1. **Print list**: Write a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.
2. **List length**: Write a function that returns the number of elements in a `list_t` list.
3. **Add node**: Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.
4. **Add node at the end**: Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.
5. **Free list**: Write a function that frees a `list_t` list.
6. **The Hare and the Tortoise**: Write a function that prints a specific message before the `main` function is executed.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files must end with a new line
- All your header files must be include guarded
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only allowed C standard library functions are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`
- No global variables allowed
- Betty-style formatting required

## Learning Objectives

- Understand when and why to use linked lists vs. arrays
- Learn how to build and use linked lists in C
